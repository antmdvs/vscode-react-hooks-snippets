# React Hooks Snippets for Visual Studio Code

> The React Hooks API is available beginning with React version 16.8. See https://reactjs.org/hooks for more information.

## Features

This extension includes a handy snippet for the [useState hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate).

\*The second placeholder value is automatically capitalized on <kbd>Tab</kbd>.

There are also a few variations for common initial state values:

| Snippet | Purpose           |
| ------- | ----------------- |
| `us`    | `useState()`      |
| `usf`   | `useState(false)` |
| `ust`   | `useState(true)`  |
| `usn`   | `useState(null)`  |

## Requirements

- Visual Studio Code 1.25.1 or higher.
- React 16.8.0 or higher.

## "What about the other hooks?"

I'll be carefully evaluating the usefulness of snippets for the remaining hooks. Please use GitHub to file/upvote requests for other hooks.
